            Book of Wisdom is a heartfelt space where inspiration meets reflection.
Itâ€™s a personal corner of the web designed to capture beautiful words, timeless quotes, and life lessons that inspire growth, motivation, and mindfulness.

Born from my passion for meaningful storytelling and self-growth, this project began as part of my LaunchCode Full-Stack Web Development journey. It combines the creativity of React for the front-end with the power of Java & Spring Boot for the back-end, creating a seamless experience for anyone who loves collecting and revisiting wisdom.

Whether youâ€™re here to save a quote that touched your heart, reflect on a personal moment, or discover new daily inspiration, Book of Wisdom is meant to be a cozy space just for you.
